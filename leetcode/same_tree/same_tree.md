Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.

Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

 
Example 1:

Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]

Output: true


Example 2:

Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]

Output: false

Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]

Output: false
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].

-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4
